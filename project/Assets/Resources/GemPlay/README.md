# Resources

Unity, as part of its Resources API, requires some files to be in a folder named Resources.
For example, to instantitate a prefab during runtime, the prefab file must be in this folder.

Runtime or editor data can be saved as a `GameObject` prefab in `Assets\Resources\GemPlay\Prefabs`.
Only editor data can be saved as a `ScriptableObject` asset in `Assets\Resources\GemPlay\ScriptableObjects`.
